This page includes resources to help you better understand NoSQL databases and to get started.

### `1.2. Introduction of MongoDB`
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents.

MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s.
