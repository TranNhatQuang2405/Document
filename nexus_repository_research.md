## `II> How to use with Docker ?`
Nexus Repository supports Docker registries with the Docker repository format for hosted and proxy repositories. You can expose these repositories to the client-side tools directly or as a repository group, which is a repository that merges and exposes the contents of multiple repositories in one convenient URL. This allows you to reduce time and bandwidth usage for accessing Docker images in a registry as well as share your images within your organization in a hosted repository. Users can then launch containers based on those images, resulting in a completely private Docker registry with all the features available in the repository manager.

***Install by docker:*** 
- Step 1: Pull image ```docker pull sonatype/nexus3```
- Step 2: Create and run container
```
# Create container nexus3 run in port 8081 and 8082 (port 8082 is used for reporistories)
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 --name nexus sonatype/nexus3
```
- Step 3: Access 127.0.0.1:8081 change password and create Repository
